        My brother AJ is one of the major reason why I do not give up in life, he has been my source of courage and purpose. No matter how much we argue (how typical siblings do), at the end of the day we always got each other's back. We may not be able to express freely, but actions spoke louder that no word can compare how much we value our love.
